This package provides tools for causal discovery (a.k.a. inferring a DAG of causal relationships from raw data) using different compression algorithms to "estimate" (in some sense) algorithmic mutual information between variables. It encapsulates the result of Gabriel Goren's Tesis de Licenciatura which led to obtaining a Licentiate Degree in Physics issued by Universidad de Buenos Aires.
